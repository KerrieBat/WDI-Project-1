### Technologies Used
It's a **fun** game in Javascript, jQuery, html, css.
### Approach taken
Javascript file is heavily commented.
I tried to make many small functions and declared all variables at the top.
Once the basic game was working, other features were added. These include keeping score for multiple games, adding the message bar and flashing the winning line.
The squares on the board have a representing array. There is an array of arrays to represent the winning combinations of squares. There are several toggles to keep track of progress, gameWon, gameDraw, turn. The message box contents changes with instructions, prompts and announcing the winner. The layout design is responsive and fabulous.

Testing revealed more opportunities to introduce more variables and if statements!

### Unsolved Problems / extensions
I could add more error traps, if you do not click start game, just a square directly, player does not switch, also after the game is won, it's possible to keep adding icons to the board'. I'd like to add a monster picker
